# Sudoku AI Solver

Sudoku Solver made in Python for 9x9 boards with 3x3 sub-grids.
The script receives a board image as input, pre-processes the image and subsequently recognizes the digits using PyTesseract.
Once the board was recognized, the 'py-sudoku' library was used to format and solve the game - the resolution could also be implemented manually, through linear programming.
